# URDF Viewer

**URDF Viewer** is a lightweight desktop application built with **Python**, **PyQt5**, and **OpenGL** for visualizing URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) models. It provides an interactive 3D interface to view robots, explore their structure, and control joint angles.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📂 Load and display any URDF robot model.
- 🦾 Visualize links and joints (supports `.stl`, `.dae`, `.obj`).
- 🎮 Interactive 3D view (zoom, pan, rotate).
- 🎚️ Auto-generated joint sliders to manipulate robot poses.
- 🌈 Material and color rendering support.
- 🧠 Works offline, no ROS or Gazebo required.
